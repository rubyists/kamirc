# KamIRC

This is a project combining a PEG for the IRC Protocol (written in Parslet) and
Eventmachine for the networking, creating a reliable and easy to use IRC client
and bot.

## Quick start

If you just want to try out the bot, edit and execute `bin/kamirc`.
You will have to change some options, like the nick and username.
This is just a quick start, if you are more interested, check out the handlers
to implement new functionality for your bot.
